**This is my first post *(woop woop)***

I thought I would start off this blog by sharing what I believe you need to begin crocheting.

Here is a simple list of equipment:
- A crochet hook 
	- I bought mine from Hobbycraft
- Some wool
	- I tend to buy these from Hobbycraft (again) or poundland :)
	- The 3 for 2 sales are great
- Internet
	- So that you can use youtube to teach you 

And that's it!

Here are some pictures of my equipment just because.
