**This is my first post *(woop woop)***

I thought I would start off this blog by sharing what I believe you need to begin crocheting.

Here is a simple list of equipment:
- A crochet hook 
	- I bought mine from Hobbycraft
- Some wool
	- I tend to buy these from Hobbycraft (again) or poundland :)
	- The 3 for 2 sales are great
- Internet
	- So that you can use youtube to teach you 

And that's it!

Here are some pictures of my equipment just because.

First off is my first crochet hook (4mm size):

And here is some other equipment of mine that aren't exactly necessary but I've collected over the years:
- Different sized hooks for different sized wools/ or if you want to make your tension of your work tighter or looser
	- This year I brought a size 3.5mm and 6mm
- stitch holder
	- For when you want to put a pause in your work
- Some tapesty needles
	- To weave in your ends
	- I also have some plastic ones but these ones in the pictures are best
- some scissors
- my crochet bag
	- I kept this from an airplane journey - it was a freebie XD
